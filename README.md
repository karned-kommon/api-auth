## Configure audience in Keycloak
- Add realm or configure existing
- Add client my-app or use existing

Goto to the newly added "Client Scopes" menu [1]
- Add Client scope 'good-service'

Within the settings of the 'good-service' goto Mappers tab
- Create Protocol Mapper 'my-app-audience' 
  - Name: my-app-audience
  - Choose Mapper type: Audience
  - Included Client Audience: my-app
  - Add to access token: on

Configure client my-app in the "Clients" menu
Client Scopes tab in my-app settings
- Add available client scopes "good-service" to assigned default client scopes

If you have more than one client repeat the steps for the other clients as well and add the good-service scope. 
The intention behind this is to isolate client access. The issued access token will only be valid for the intended audience.
This is thoroughly described in Keycloak's documentation [1,2].
